# Airbyte Article Guidelines

If you're interested in writing content for Airbyte, we are excited to have you! These guidelines are a general guide that will help increase your chances of getting a publication on the Airbyte blog.

## Values

To ensure high quality, we look for the following qualities in our posts:

- **Understandable to all.**
  Use simple language and don't assume that your reader knows everything.
- **Clear value proposition.**
  The reader should have a very clear idea of the value they will get from the post and it should be a relevant and practical use case. A good example would be: "Visualizing your Stripe data using Airbyte, Looker, and Snowflake."
- **Comprehensive**
  Leave nothing to the imagination, explicitly guide the reader from point A to point B.
  

## Structure

1.  **Abstract/Introduction**

What will the reader learn and/or achieve after following the article? If it is a tutorial, set an explicit and tangible goal/end-state for the reader to achieve. If it's a piece of educational content or a more abstract post, set a goal around understanding a specific concept or idea.

Additionally, this should be the time to use a hook to bring the reader in and feel excited about consuming the content. Do this in your own style.
   
2. **Prerequisites**

If it's a tutorial, clearly define everything a reader would need to follow along. If it's a more abstract blog post, this can generally be skipped over.

3. **Body**

The meat of the content. Lean in to your own writing style, we want your voice! If this is a tutorial, divide the body into easily digestible sections.

Whenever possible, add code snippets, screenshots, and other relevant context to provide sufficient explanatory media for the reader.

4. **Conclusion**

Wrap up and reiterate the value that the reader has gained from the post. Then write a few sentences about steps for the future and what is left to be explored.
