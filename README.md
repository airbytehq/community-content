## Our Philosophy
Airbyte is fully open by design. We share our [roadmap](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/projects/1), [strategy](https://docs.airbyte.io/company-handbook/company-handbook/strategy) and everything about our [business model](https://docs.airbyte.io/company-handbook/company-handbook/business-model). 

This repository is also a way to share about our [roadmap](https://github.com/airbytehq/community-content/projects/1) in terms of content publications, so you can vote on the articles, tutorials and videos we plan to work on, and also contribute them!
