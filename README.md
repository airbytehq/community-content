## Our Philosophy
Airbyte is fully open by design. We share our [roadmap](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/projects/1), [strategy](https://docs.airbyte.io/company-handbook/company-handbook/strategy) and everything about our [business model](https://docs.airbyte.io/company-handbook/company-handbook/business-model). 

This repository is also a way to share about our [roadmap](https://github.com/airbytehq/community-content/projects/1) in terms of content publications, so you can vote on the articles, tutorials and videos we plan to work on, but also to participate in them. 

After all, the content is at the service of Airbyte's community of contributors and users, and who better knows what tutorials they need: our community!
